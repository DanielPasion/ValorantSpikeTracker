# ValorantSpikeTracker

Hello! This was a program I made that would recognize when the spike in the video game Valorant would be currently planted, and would also have a physical and audio
timer for when the bomb would go off. It was made completly in Python using various libraries. If you would like to use this for yourself, you will need to import all
the audio files underneath "audioFilesPlankton","spike.png" and "ValFont.ttf" for this to work on your own computer.
Hope You Enjoy!
